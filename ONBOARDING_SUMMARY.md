# Onboarding Flow - Implementation Summary

## Project Complete

A comprehensive landing page onboarding flow with a 5-question preference questionnaire and intelligent stock recommendation engine has been successfully implemented.

---

## What Was Built

### 1. Complete Onboarding Flow
- **Landing Page** at `/onboarding` with welcome message and feature highlights
- **5-Question Questionnaire** at `/onboarding/questions` with multi-step navigation
- **Recommendations Page** at `/onboarding/recommendations` showing personalized stock picks
- **Seamless Integration** with existing calendar at `/calendar`

### 2. Five Questions Implemented

| # | Question | Type | Details |
|---|----------|------|---------|
| 1 | Which sectors interest you most? | Multiple choice (checkboxes) | 10 sectors, select 1-3 or "All sectors" |
| 2 | What's your investment timeline? | Slider (1-5) | Day trading → Buy & hold |
| 3 | How often do you check your portfolio? | Radio buttons | 5 frequency options |
| 4 | What's your risk tolerance? | Slider (1-5) | Very conservative → Aggressive |
| 5 | How do you want to build your portfolio? | Radio with descriptions | Celebrity/DIY/Mix strategies |

### 3. Recommendation Engine Algorithm

**Scoring System (100 points max):**
- **40%** - Sector matching (user's selected sectors vs stock sectors)
- **30%** - Risk tolerance alignment (conservative/moderate/aggressive stocks)
- **20%** - Investment timeline fit (day trading vs long-term holds)
- **10%** - Portfolio strategy preference (celebrity trending vs personalized)

**Output:** Top 8-12 stocks with:
- Match quality label (Excellent/Good/Moderate/Basic)
- Match percentage score
- Specific reasons why each stock was recommended
- Direct links to view stock events

### 4. Database Schema

**New Table:** `user_preferences`
```sql
- id (uuid, primary key)
- user_id (text, indexed)
- sectors (text array)
- investment_timeline (text: '1'-'5')
- check_frequency (text)
- risk_tolerance (text: '1'-'5')
- portfolio_strategy (text)
- completed_at (timestamp)
- created_at (timestamp)
- updated_at (timestamp)
```

**Migration File:** `drizzle/0004_lively_millenium_guard.sql`

### 5. API Routes Created

#### `/api/onboarding/preferences`
- **POST:** Save user preferences to database
- **GET:** Retrieve user's latest preferences

#### `/api/onboarding/recommendations`
- **POST:** Generate recommendations from provided preferences
